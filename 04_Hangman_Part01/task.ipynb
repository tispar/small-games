    "You are in land full of dragons. Some of them friendly some rather not. The player stands in front of two caves. In one cave houses a nice dragon eager to share his treasure, the other one contains a wild beast who will eat the player on sight. The player has to choose one of the caves and live (or die) with the consequences.\n",

    "Create the following functions:\n",
    "-displayIntro() Displays a flavor text to describe the situation to the player.\n",
    "-chooseCave() asks the player for '1' or '2' as input. if the player isn't smart enough to provide one of these inputs, just ask again.\n",
    "-checkCave() Determines with randint if which of the caves is the \"good\" one, compares it with the player's choice and gives an output message\n",
