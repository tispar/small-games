# small-games

Welcome to this repository of mine.

Here you find small python games which might help you learning python. 

I'm currently creating seperate Jupyter Notebooks to improve the documentation of the code provided. 

If you prefer trying to create the games yourself before looking at the code check the task-document.

Feel free to contact me when questions or problems occur.
